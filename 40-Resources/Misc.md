**Arbitrary and fixed precision** 
- In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **arbitrary-precision arithmetic**, also called **bignum arithmetic**, **multiple-precision arithmetic**, or sometimes **infinite-precision arithmetic**, indicates that [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") are performed on numbers whose [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit") of [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(arithmetic) "Precision (arithmetic)") are limited only by the available [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computers) "Memory (computers)") of the host system. This contrasts with the faster [fixed-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-precision_arithmetic "Fixed-precision arithmetic") found in most [arithmetic logic unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit "Arithmetic logic unit") (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") of precision.
- Arbitrary-precision arithmetic can also be used to avoid [overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow "Arithmetic overflow"), which is an inherent limitation of fixed-precision arithmetic
- Arbitrary precision is used in applications where the speed of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") is not a limiting factor, or where [precise results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_error_mitigation "Floating point error mitigation") with very large numbers are required.
- Numerous [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms "Algorithms") have been developed to efficiently perform arithmetic operations on numbers stored with arbitrary precision. In particular, supposing that _N_ digits are employed, algorithms have been designed to minimize the asymptotic [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory") for large _N_.
- The simplest algorithms are for [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), where one simply adds or subtracts the digits in sequence, carrying as necessary, which yields an O(_N_) algorithm (see [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")).
- Arbitrary-precision arithmetic in most computer software is implemented by calling an external [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science) "Library (computer science)") that provides [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type "Data type") and [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine "Subroutine") to store numbers with the requested precision and to perform computations.

**Threads**
- Threads share .text, .data, heap, file descriptors, signal and signal handlers, current working directory, user and group id, 
- Each thread has a unique thread id, set of registers, stack --> stack pointer, return value,  local variables,  signal mask, priority, errno 

**Cache**
- Caches are physically addressed but virtually indexed.  for ex: the lower 12 bits of an address is taken from the logical address of a program and the top 20 bits is obtained from the mmu.
